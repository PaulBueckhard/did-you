On the homepage you will start out with an empty board list. On the left of the page type in the name of your board in the "Add board" field and hit enter or press the "+" button. You can then click on the board name to reveal your newly created board. In the text field "Add task" type in a task and press enter or the "+" button to add that task to your current board.
